A mostly FOSS, fully-featured terrain generator. As of October 10, 2018, this project is still in development.

This project is a terrain generator using a multitude of techniques, ones commonly seen in proprietary terrain generators, to generate a realistic 3D terrain heightmaps, at computer-crashing resolutions, for completely free (commercial or otherwise) use.

__Why?__ Because I have seen, almost exclusively, lots of closed-source, fee/license-based terrain generators, and I am very interested in terrain generation techniques. So, I decided to add to the market of terrain generators for the impoverished. Obviously, this will very likely never be as good as any proprietary software, afterall, I don't get paid to do this. However, the aim is to have something that is as-good or almost-as-good as a lot of those generators out there.

__TODO__  
1. Get OpenGL, imgui, and SDL and up and running and working together
2. Design the GUI for output customization
3. Add a whole bunch of terrain generation techniques
4. Design some sort of flowchart or tree system for output manipulation (?)
5. Use OpenGL to generate a bitmap or 3d model of terrain, and then get texture maps or shaders on the mode/map
6. Allow the user to designate a 2D volume of the inifinitely-generated terrain for heightmap export.
7. A lot more! Like creating an island or crater out of the volume, some kind of preview system, etc.

This is just the beginning. Feel free to contribute to the project, or fork it for your own.
